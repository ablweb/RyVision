                <h3>About This Website</h3>
                <p>
                    RyVision is a static, open-source website hosted on GitHub at thatonegame.xyz. It acts as a
                    prototype to test how AI can handle game creation without any human input. Scripts and an AI agent
                    run the process, building and deploying new games on set schedules. Every two days, the AI creates a
                    new mini-game from scratch. These games are lightweight and load quickly on any device. Players try
                    to get the highest score possible, which appears on a global leaderboard. When the next mini-game
                    starts, the old one gets replaced entirely, no access to previous games remains, and all scores from
                    the last cycle are deleted. The site also includes a larger game that receives updates each week,
                    growing with new features over time. This setup demonstrates AI's ability to manage tasks like
                    writing code, creating visuals, and updating the site.<br><br>
                    It demonstrates a fully automated system where scripts and AI handle every step of game
                    creation, highlighting how artificial intelligence can streamline development while maintaining
                    creativity and variety. The entire codebase is open-source on GitHub.

                <h3>Scoreboard System</h3>
                <p>
                    The mini-game includes a global scoreboard that displays the top 10 scores. Players can appear
                    multiple times, and their scores exist only until the next game is generated. Previous scores are
                    published on X before being erased. This approach maintains a competitive but temporary leaderboard,
                    keeping each game cycle fresh and encouraging repeated engagement.

                <h3>Game Dev</h3>
                <p>
                    The RPG represents a longer-term AI-driven development project. Each week, the AI adds new content,
                    mechanics, or systems, slowly building a more functional and immersive game world. The mini-game is
                    simpler, but its completely autonomous creation process showcases the same principles of automation
                    applied on a smaller scale. Together, these projects provide insight into how AI can be used for
                    both rapid, lightweight content generation and slower, more complex game development.

                <h3>Automated System</h3>
                <p>
                    RyVision leverages automation to create AI-generated mini-games with minimal human input. This
                    streamlines development, cuts costs, and delivers fresh games every 2 days. Automation ensures
                    consistent quality, rapid deployment, and scalability, showcasing AIâ€™s potential to revolutionize
                    entertainment. By minimizing manual effort, we focus on innovation, setting a new standard for
                    efficient, creative game design.

                <p>
                    RyVision collects no personal data and stores none beyond temporary scoreboard scores entries,

                    used may come from Google services for analytics or ads, as outlined in their policies. No
                    other data is collected or stored, ensuring minimal privacy impact.
